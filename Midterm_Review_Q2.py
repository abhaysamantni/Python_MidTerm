# A Personal Fitness Tracker is a wearable device that tracks your physical activity, calories burned, heart rate,
# sleeping patterns, and so on. One common physical activity that most of these devices track is the number of steps
# you take each day. You have been provided a file “steps.txt”, which contains the number of steps a person has taken
# each day for the year 2019. There are 365 lines in the file, and each line contains the number of steps taken during a day.
# The first line is the number of steps taken on January 1st, second line is the number of steps taken on January 2nd,
# and so forth. Write a program that reads the file, and performs the following tasks:

# 2.1 Display steps taken on 03/01 (March 01)
# 2.2 Display the average number of steps taken for each month.
# 2.3 User Matplotlib (or similar plotting library) functions to display the number of steps taken on Y-axis.
# X-axis are numbers from 1 to 366.

# note: The data is from a year that was not a leap year, so February has 28 days.
